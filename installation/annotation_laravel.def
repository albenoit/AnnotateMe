   This is a virtual machine to run the Laravel based Data annotation tool developped for LISTIC Lab, Annecy, France by students from Computer Science Dept of IUT Annecy, Universite Savoie Mont Blanc
   Addityionnal packages should be located from https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages and installed using the 'apk add' command

   This demo script is inspired by a docker cntainer build tutorial : https://blog.pusher.com/docker-for-development-laravel-php/

   TODO: why not starting from this to build up the full container and distribute the Annotation tool
   For now, you can :
   0. read the singularity doc and tutorials: https://sylabs.io/docs/ and install it
   1. build the image using command line as root on your machine : build annotation_laravel.sif annotation_laravel.def
   2. run it :
       -> as a shell : singularity shell annotation_laravel.sif
       -> as a program : singularity run annotation_laravel.sif
              --> this will show you the message defined in the runscript command:  "YES, my container runs! TODO: launch the web server !"
